Perfect Numbers
---------------

Before submitting this file, make sure that there are no more TODO
placeholders remaining in the file (and remove this comment too).

Q1. Roughly how long did it take your computer to do the search? How many perfect numbers were found and what were they?
A1. TODO:About 6.199s. 4 perfect number; 6,28,496,8128.

Q2. Record the timing results for `findPerfects` that you observed into a table.
A2. TODO:

Q3. Does it take the same amount of work to compute `isPerfect` on the number 10 as it does on the number 1000? Why or why not? Does it take the same amount of work for `findPerfects` to search the range of numbers from 1-1000 as it does to search the numbers from 1000-2000? Why or why not?
A3. TODO:For 'isPerfect' number 10 and 1000 need different time. Cause it will cost more time when doing the function 'divisorSum' for 1000.
         For 'findPerfect' the same reason.

Q4. Extrapolate from the data you gathered and make a prediction: how long will it take `findPerfects` to reach the fifth perfect number?
A4. TODO: 33,000,000/120000 = 275 times. It will take about 48 days.

Q5. Do any of the tests still pass even with this broken function? Why or why not?
A5. TODO: can not if it is in the same student_test. Can if it is in different test. test do not change anything in the origin function.

Q6. Describe the testing strategy you used for your test cases to confirm `smarterSum` is working correctly.
A6. TODO: we know 28 is a perfect number so I choose 27 and 29 also 25 which is a sqrt int number.

Q7. Record your timing results for `findPerfectsSmarter` into a table.
A7. TODO:

           发现单独跑一个数量的测试和4个倍增的数量测试，最后的计算时间不同 可能是计算机跑一会导致的计算能力下降。

Q8. Make a prediction: how long will `findPerfectsSmarter` take to reach the fifth perfect number?
A8. TODO: 33,000,000/4800000 = 6.875. So the time is 6.875*sqrt(6.875) = 18.026 times. So it will take about 18min.

Q9. Explain how you chose your specific test cases and why they lead you to be confident `findNthPerfectEuclid` is working correctly.
A9. TODO: first using 1 cause 1 is a boundary number.not figure out other reason.

Soundex
-------

Q10. What is the Soundex code for "Angelou"? What is the code for your own surname?
A10. TODO:"Angelou" = A524; Jia = J000

Q11. Before writing any code, brainstorm your plan of attack and sketch how you might decompose the work into smaller tasks. Briefly describe your decomposition strategy.
A11. TODO:1.按顺序判断每一个字符是啥，并转化为数字；当发现他不是字母时，就不做任何操作。
          2.判断数字是否有重复，并将重复消除
          3.判断处理后的数字的位数，保证为4
          4.将第一位数字变成字符

Q12. Think about one or more examples of a class of names that the Soundex system might not work well for. Explain what this class of names is and why the system might incorrectly group them or mis-categorize one of the names.
A12. TODO：sanbol'angel和sandials'bolso等有着较长前缀的词

Q13. Suppose you are a software engineer working for the U.S. government. You have been tasked with implementing a system that collects names as part of the Census survey and analyzes these names using a phonetic algorithm. Your boss suggests using Soundex and notes that the algorithm is only expected to work for ASCII-encoded strings, since supporting Unicode would require extra work and time. What would your response be and why? What representational harms might result from building a system that exclusively uses Soundex and/or ASCII?
A13. TODO：没想法
